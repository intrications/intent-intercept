Intent Intercept Android app
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/k3b/intent-intercept.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/k3b/intent-intercept)

This app is forked from https://github.com/intrications/intent-intercept which is not maintained any more.

Summary: View inter-app communication

Description:
This app attempts to intercept as many intents as possible in order to examine
their contents. This helps when trying to develop an app that reacts to a
particular intent.
