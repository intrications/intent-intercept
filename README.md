================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intrications/intent-intercept.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intrications/intent-intercept)

Summary: View inter-app communication

Description:
This app attempts to intercept as many intents as possible in order to examine
their contents. This helps when trying to develop an app that reacts to a
particular intent.

Some details of the intent can now be edited before resending it.

Intent Intercept is available here:
